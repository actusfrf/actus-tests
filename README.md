actus-tests
=======

This repository contains a set of test beds against which the [`actus-core`](https://github.com/actusfrf/actus-core) library is tested. The tests are implemented in json-files and organized in one file per ACTUS Contract Type. Each test bed provides a number of reference contracts, i.e. the respective contract terms, and corresponding event schedule. Hence, the tests may be used to validate an implementation of the ACTUS specification.

Status
------

The ACTUS standards, it's reference implementation and also the test beds in this repository are subject to change. Thus, please make sure to test against the latest release of the tests.
